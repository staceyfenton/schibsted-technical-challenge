# Schibsted technical challenge #

This is my response to a developer test for Schibsted. The task was to display the results of a feed onto a page, and provide a basic form to filter those results.

A web server is required to run this application (for example, [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)), or you can view the [online demo](http://staceyfenton.com/schibsted).

Built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and the [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) CSS framework.
